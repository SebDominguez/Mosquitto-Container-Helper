### How to Install



1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SebDominguez/mosquitto-docker-helper.git
```

Or download the script and the docker-compose file directly:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SebDominguez/Mosquitto-Container-Helper/refs/heads/master/mosquitto.sh -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SebDominguez/Mosquitto-Container-Helper/refs/heads/master/docker-compose.yml
```

2. Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x mosquitto_helper.sh
```

3. Ensure `docker-compose` is installed on your system. The script will automatically detect whether to use `docker-compose` or the `docker compose` command.

### How to Use

#### Start Mosquitto Container
```bash
./mosquitto_helper.sh start
```

#### Create a Mosquitto User
```bash
./mosquitto_helper.sh createuser
```

You will be prompted to enter the username and password for the new Mosquitto user.

#### List All Mosquitto Users
```bash
./mosquitto_helper.sh listusers
```

#### Delete a Mosquitto User
```bash
./mosquitto_helper.sh deleteuser <username>
```

Replace `<username>` with the actual username you wish to delete.

#### Update the Mosquitto Container
```bash
./mosquitto_helper.sh update
```

This will pull the latest image and restart the container.

---

### Configuration

By default, the script expects the following folder structure:

- `./config/` - The local directory where the Mosquitto configuration is stored.
- `passwordfile` - The file where Mosquitto stores user credentials.

If these paths need to be adjusted, modify the `LOCAL_CONFIG` and `CONTAINER_CONFIG` variables in the script.
